As we discussed, quality is not only about checking the final product, but about managing standards throughout the entire project. It begins with understanding what quality means and why it is important for meeting customer expectations.

We also learned that Project Quality Management focuses on clear objectives such as reducing errors, avoiding rework, and delivering value. These objectives are achieved through the three key components: quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

Quality planning helps define standards early, quality assurance ensures correct processes are followed during the project, and quality control checks the final outputs. Together, these processes help prevent problems and improve project outcomes.

The example we discussed clearly showed how managing quality at each stage leads to successful results.

Therefore, effective Project Quality Management ensures customer satisfaction, reduces costs, and increases the likelihood of project success.
